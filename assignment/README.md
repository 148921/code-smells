# Exercise - Fix the smelly code

Form groups of about 3 people and review Pub.java in nerdschool.bar (pull from the nerdschool repository on
github). Which code smells can you find? Refactor to remove smell(s). There is a small test suite (nerdschool.bar.PubPricesTest.java)
that will help you along the way. Introduce more tests if you need them.


You will learn to:

- Identify bad code
- Fix code smells
- Refactor with tests

## Required software and tools for this exercise

## Bar mess

:pencil2: Open `pom.xml` in IntelliJ by selecting *Import project* from the Welcome Screen. You can also use File --> New --> Project from existing sources. 

:pencil2: Run all the tests and examine the code. 

:question: What does this code do? Before you start changing the code, understand what the code does. 

:pencil2: Refactor the code step by step so that it becomes more readable. Introduce more tests if you need them.
